# i-am-your-environment
Basic configuration for iterm2/ZSH/vim for unix and windows.

These is not intended to be a guideline, it is just my tools configurations.

To start using this environment run release_the_kraken.sh, this will install, depending on the OS, the next tools:
 - iterm2
 - oh-my-zsh
 - git
 - homebrew
 - sdkman
 - npm 
 - spotify
 - npm
 - whatsapp
 - chrome
 - postman
 - slack
 - cygwin (Windows)
 - puty (Windows)
 - chocolatey (Windows)
 - install inconsolata font
 
After that the script will configurate iterm2/cygwin with oh-my-zsh using steeef theme.
